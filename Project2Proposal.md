## 1.0	Project Overview
### 1.1 Abstract
The player controls a spherical character in a top-down perspective. The ball has a physical feeling to it, bouncing off of walls and obstacles. The player loses by falling off the level or running into dangerous obstacles. The player wins by reaching the end of the level unharmed.

### 1.2.	Target Customer
The target customer for this project is people who like casual games.

### 1.3.	Search Words 
Game, casual, 2D, interactive, real-time, slick2D, lwjgl


### 1.4.	Scope and Objectives
1. Real-time graphics.
2. Player controls physically-affected character.
3. Player can lose by falling off the level or by hitting obstacles.
4. Player will win when reaching the goal.
5. Multiple levels.
6. Main menu.


## 2.0	Team and Constraints

### 2.1.	Team profile

***Chunlei Li***<br>
**Qualifications:**:I finished Java 1A classes，also had an experience work at a company that really need some good software to help with their stock managing. That’s why i feel like it will be super helpful if we could create the software that can deal with the similar issue that may happen in any companies. It will definitely save lots of manfully work and lower the miscounting or recording on any similar stocking system of  the companies, such as libraries, community services, manufactories.
 <br>
**Strengths**: I believe I have a strong sense of responsibility, especially when we work as a team. Also, great communication skill. I could learn new things efficiently with full of energy. I always have a positive attitude to life and like new challenges, because it feels fantastic when i could figure difficulty problems out.
<br>

***Stefano Mauri***	<br>
**Qualifications:**: Experience in Java, MySQL and HTML<br>
**Strengths**: Personal experience working as a stockroom manager and in shipping and receiving for a small business.<br>

***Christian Wookey***<br>
**Qualifications:**: Programming Experience: Objective-C, C, C++, Python, Lua. Design Experience: Adobe Photoshop, Krita, Adobe Illustrator, iOS design standards.<br>
**Strengths**: I have experience programming for UI/UX design. I do graphical design on a semi-regular basis. I have experience working in an Amazon Prime warehouse, which uses a virtual inventory system similar to the one we are implementing.<br>

***Junliu Zhang***	<br>
**Qualifications:**: I have taken some Java courses before. So I basically know how to use Java for programming. I also learned knowledge about quality assurance, which is quite related to software engineering. Moreover, I had some project experience in the school and company which gave me the idea of how the project works. My accountant experience also let me understand the importance of shipping and tracking products for a company and provided me the insight of how to make  stockroom system better.<br>
**Strengths**: I’m a quick learner and work well under pressure. I’m responsible to my work and take every small part seriously. Honestly I’m good at working on some small parts and able to find some small mistakes on them. I’m a very gentle and thoughtful person and I believe I can be a good team member as well. <br>

***Andre Zhu***	<br>
**Qualifications:**:I have a decent amount of computer science coursework and a couple of projects under my belt. I have experience with MySQL and databases in general, which should be useful for this project in particular.
**Strengths**:I do well in program design and implementation, as well as working until something is finished once I have started it. 


### 2.1.	Challenges
#### Technical Challenges
* Real-time applications are new for some members of our team.
* Need to learn a complex library (libGdx) in order to complete this application. While libraries help speed up development, they also have a learning curve of their own. Additionally, it does not use the previous libraries we used (JavaFX and MySQL Connector Java), so their is some sunk time in that. However, the nature of the project requires these different libraries.
#### Non-Technical Challenges
* The games need a lot of art assets compared to our previous project.
* Games are complex systems that can be difficult to test due to unpredictable player behavior.


### 2.2.	Assumptions and Constraints

#### Assumptions:

***Meetings***<br>
 - Team will be meeting twice before and after class.
    - Tuesdays, 1:00 - 2:00 PM, Library
    - Thursday, 4:00 - 5:00 PM, Library
 - Scheduled library meetings and additional/emergency meetings may fluctuate based on the Team’s project progress.
    - If the Team finishes the weekly task before the scheduled deadline, scheduled library meetings may be cancelled (with a unanimous vote from the entire Team).
    - If a team member misses more than the maximum meetings allotted, the rest of the Team will convene and decide if further action (termination) is appropriate.
    - If a team member misses ANY meeting without timely notice to the rest of the team, Bita will be notified and individual point will be deducted from that team member’s score for that weekly task.

***Attendance***<br>
- Team members must attend every class and meeting.
    - Team member may miss no more than one class meeting AND one library meeting. (with timely notice to the rest of the Team) during the duration of the assignment.
      If a team member is not available to physically attend a meeting, they may attend the meeting via video chat (eg. Google Hangouts, Skype) without penalization.

***Communication***<br>
- Team will be using Canvas mail tool, Google Hangouts and group texts to communicate.
    - Team members must send out a message to the rest of the Team once they have completed their job.
    - Team members must respond to messages requiring a response within one hour (unless a timely notice is given to the rest of the Team).
    - If the Team decides an additional/emergency meeting is in order, then the meeting can be conducted either physically, in person, or virtually, by means of phone calls or video chats.
***Deadlines***<br>
- Deadlines are posted on the team schedule: https://goo.gl/4uPGc7
    - Each team member must meet deadlines when submitting drafts, giving feedback ,to other team members, and turning deliverables in to Bita..
    - If a team member misses one deadline, a warning will be given, and that team member will be required to submit feedback for the next task 24 hours in advance from the following deadline.
    - If a team member misses two deadlines, the rest of the Team will convene and decide if further action (termination) is appropriate.
    - If a team member misses more than one deadline, the rest of the Team will convene and decide if further action (termination) is appropriate.

***Files***<br>
- Team will be sharing files using Google Drive.
    - Google Drive:https://goo.gl/DoS5ef

***Backup and Recovery***<br>
- Requirements for task not met
    - If the requirements of the task submitted to Bita are not met and bounced back, an additional meeting (physical or virtual) must be held to discuss and fix all issues with the task, and re-submit as soon as possible.
- Team member is uncommitted
    - If a team member is constantly missing deadlines, unresponsive to messages, and not attending meetings, the rest of the Team will convene and decide if further action (termination) is appropriate.
- Team member is uncooperative
    - If a team member is unwilling to consider other team members’ ideas and/or input, or is exhibiting negative behavior/attitudes towards the Team and the assignment, the rest of the Team will convene and decide if further action (termination) is appropriate.
